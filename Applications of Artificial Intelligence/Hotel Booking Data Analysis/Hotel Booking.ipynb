    "- How to instantiate and customize XGBoost models\n",
    "- How to use XGBoost's DMatrix to optimize performance\n",
    "- How to evaluate models in XGBoost using the right metrics\n",

    "### **Acknowledgements**\n",
    "The dataset was downloaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/). The data is originally from an article called [Hotel booking demand datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida, and Luis Nunes. It was then cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md). For the purposes of this live training, it was further pre-processed to have cleaner ready-to-use features (e.g., dropping irrelevant columns, one-hot-encoding).

We want to minimize this to have the smallest possible loss. `binary:logistic` is the default for classifiers. `binary:logistic` outputs the actual predicted probability of the positive class (in our case, that a booking is cancelled).\n",
